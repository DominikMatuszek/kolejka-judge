An essential component of the automated testing systems is the judge, i.e. a program assessing the submitted solutions.
**kolejka-judge** is a library, which aids the programmer in the effective developing of such programs, in a concise, yet expressive manner.
**kolejka-judge** is used to test student programs in [satori](https://bitbucket.org/satoriproject/satori/) system using [kolejka](https://github.com/kolejka/kolejka) as backend.

The original version of **kolejka-judge** was designed and developed by [Tomasz Zieli≈Ñski](https://github.com/zielinskit/kolejka-judge).
