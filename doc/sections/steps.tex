\section{Steps}\label{sec:steps}

    Steps together form a checking \textit{pipeline}, each of them being responsible for a logically separate assignment.
    They are divided into two categories: \textit{commands} (specifying the program to run) and \textit{tasks}
    (arbitrary Python code).
    \phantomsection \label{sec:ExecutionStatistics} Each of them returns an optional object with execution statistics.
    Gathered data varies greatly between the environments, but there are a few properties that should always be
    accessible.
    Those include \code{time}, \code{memory}, and \code{cpus}
    (with subproperties \code{system} and \code{user} indicating the time that was used by the processor).

\subsection{DependentExpr} \label{sec:DependentExpr}
    Commands' arguments support a special mechanism, called \python{DependentExpr}.
    It represents a lazy object, that takes an unknown number of variable names, and a function which is used to
    reduce the contents stored (via the \hyperref[sec:set_variable]{\python{ExecutionEnvironment.set_variable()}} method)
    under those names to a single object.
    For the most common use case, where only one variable name is given and no reduction is needed, the function
    argument can be omitted.
    \python{DependentExpr} will be evaluated only just before the command execution.
